A WordPress plugin that implements a basic library collection and
circulation system.

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin started as a portable, cross-platform system that
the Wendell Free Library could use as a transistion system from its current
paper card based circulation system to the system that will eventually
be rolled out by the regional library system.  It has 'morphed' to a
web-based successor to Deepwoods Software's Home Librarian 3 system.

This plugin implements a simple and basic, web-based, library catalog
and circulation system.  There are short codes that can be added to
pages of a WordPress site to search and display items in the library
collection.  And there are back-end (admin) pages that implement
managment of the collection, management of patrons (users) of the
library, as well as implementing the functionallity of a  circulation
desk. 

== Installation ==

The plugin can be installed by uploading the Zip file to the plugin
installer or unpacking the zip file under the plugins directory.

There are some options that can be set, but these options are not needed
for basic operation.  There are three short codes that can be added to
pages or posts for front end searching and display of your library
collection and there are a number of back-end (dashboard) pages for all
of the management of your library.

Please read the PDF User Manual for complete documentation on using this
plugin. This is a fairly non-trivial plugin, and there is not a simple
quick-start guide for the impatient.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Support is handled either with [Deepwoods Software's Bugzilla][bugreport]
(submit any bugs and feature requests to the Bugzilla) or though the
[Deepwoods Software's Support page][support] (use this for  comments or
for general questions).

= Where are the admin menus? =

You've successfully installed the Web Librarian, but none of the admin
menus (Patrons, Collection, Circulation Types, Circulation Desk, or
Circulation Stats) show up. Why is this? This is because you are
probably logged in as the web site adminstrator (your user role is
Adminstrator).  You need to create at least a user with a user role of
Librarian and then log in as this user.  Optionally, you can also
create users with roles of Senior Aid or Volunteer, who have lesser
privilidges -- these latter users make sense if you are a large enough
library that has additional staff ("Senior Aid") or uses additional
workers ("Volunteer") who man the circulation desk(s).  It is important
to read the subsection titled "User Role Setup" in the "Installation and
basic setup" section *carefully* and to be sure you understand it fully.
